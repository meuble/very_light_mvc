Very Light MVC
==============

Very Light MVC is an attempt to build a basic MVC structure in PHP. It should help build small website while keeping logical parts separated one from each other.

I'm clearly not an expert in PHP and this was build for a one time project. I tried to write code as strong and secure as I could, but use it at your own risks. I won't be responsible for your production site.

## Basic Structure

### /app

This folder will contains your application. Almost everything you'll write will go there. The 3 different parts of the MVC structure is represented here : Controllers, Models and Views.

#### /app/controllers

That's where your controllers will be. You should name your files from the ressource it's supposed to serve. For a controller managing the User model, you should have the file named `users_controller.php`, containing something like :

    <?php
      require_once CWD . '/lib/controller.php';
    
      class UsersController extends Controller {
      }
    ?>

#### /app/models

This is the prefered place for all your business logic. Every classes that is database related should be here.
Here again, naming convention advise you to have classes named like `user.php` having something like :

    <?php
      require_once CWD . '/lib/model.php';
    
      class User extends BaseModel {
      }
    ?>

#### /app/helpers

You can place here any file you may need. Keep in mind that there is no autoload for any file in here, except for the default `application_helper.php`, so you may need to include them in the `setup.php` file or elsewhere.

#### /app/views

Here goes the vews for each actions of each controllers. The naming convention is : `views/controller_name/action_name.php`. For example, for the edit action of the users controller, we expect to have a file like : `views/users/edit.php`

### /config

It contains the configuration files. You'll find an exemple file as `development.ini.example` that you can rename into `development.ini` or `production.ini` depending on your environement setup.

### /lib

It contains all the Very Light MVC files. It's composed of a request, a routeur, and the MVC files.

### /public

There goes your static public files (CSS, Javascript, images...)
